This beer is blowing us away. It is outstanding.  It tastes like ripe pineapple, orange sherbet, and mango sugar with minimal bitterness. Galaxy at it\u2019s absolute best. The story of our homage to an incredible place:Brewing a Galaxy hop-filled Double IPA with the name Autumn seems contrary to tradition. With the name Autumn, one might think copper-colored lagers, sessionable porters, and pumpkin-spiced ales of all shapes and sizes\u2026 so let me explain.In the Australian Autumn of 2019, in March, we ventured to Australia to meet the folks behind these hops for the first time. Having brewed with Galaxy for almost seven years, it was exhilarating to get the opportunity to travel to the other side of the world in search of context and inspiration.What we encountered when we got there was well beyond our wildest expectations. Aside from the energy of the people, the immeasurable beauty of the coastline and countryside, and the eclectic culture of culinary delight, what inspired us the most was the focus and dedication of the folks as Rostrevor Hop Gardens in Victoria and Bushy Park Estates in Tasmania.Most of the operations are overseen by generational farmers who have been working the land for over 100 years. Their deep understanding of climate, seasonal shifts, and hands-on adjustment lends itself to a consistent, high quality, immensely distinctive hops that are enjoyed in every corner of the world.We had the opportunity to enjoy Very Green, brewed with roughly 60% Galaxy, three days after it was canned an entire world away with the scent of just-plucked Galaxy cones in our hands with the sun shining on our face in the middle of one of the most pristine valleys on Earth. To call it memorable would be an understatement - it was transcendent. Talk about full circle. It provided us with a lifetime of inspiration to honor the work of the folks who make a hop like this possible. For the rest of our lives, each time we drink a beer with hops from Rostrevor or Bushy Park we will be instantly transported back to the memory of a place that is full of heart, soul, focus, immeasurable beauty, and dedication. Our hope is that with Autumn - brewed with 100% Galaxy hops paired with our house yeast - we are able to share that story, and bring a little bit of that experience, back home with you in each can.Enjoy."},{type:"case",title:"Haze Flagship Double IPA",price:"103.20",quantity:"24",beer:"Haze",debug:"This listing is for one case of 24 cans of Haze.HAZE  (Double IPA - 8.2%) - Our Double IPA!
