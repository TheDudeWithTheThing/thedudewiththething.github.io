Many of the beers from the early years of the American beer movement that inspired us to do what we do showcase this incredible variety. It is with great pleasure that we present to you, in true Tree House fashion, our tribute to this genre-defining hop in Turbo! \\n\\nPulling inspiration from our recent trip to the other side of the world, whose name is inspired by our brewer Porter, the world\u2019s foremost Cascade nut, Turbo beer contains three varieties of Cascade; American, New Zealand, and Australian. American Cascade contains high levels of the terpene Myrcene, responsible for the palate-smacking grapefruit quality that puts Cascade on the map. The New Zealand variety also leans towards a more fruity and bright expression, enhancing the intersection of citrus and pine resin notes. Underneath this frontline of citrus power, Australian hops contain higher levels of Humulene, an earthy, spicy, herbal terpene closely associated with hop\u2019s cousin, cannabis. Many hoppy beers are described as presenting a rich intoxicating \u201cdankness\u201d thanks to this unique aromatic quality. \\n\\nAfter substantial kettle and whirlpool additions, this beer was hopped at a whopping five pounds per bbl of this trio, fully articulating Cascade\u2019s multifarious qualities. We have never experienced such an amplified profile as this; it truly crosses the threshold of hoppy nostalgia into an entirely new realm. This beer is as provocative as it is edifying and should be drunk immediately\u2014Enjoy!"},{"type":"four","title":"Breakfast Shake","price":24.2,"quantity":"4","beer":"Breakfast Shake","description":"(Triple IPA, 9.0% ABV, 16oz) Breakfast Shake is a Triple IPA brewed with lactose sugar, banana, and strawberry.
